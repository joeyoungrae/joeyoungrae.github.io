## Welcome to visit My blog  
---------  
  
This blog's purpose is to collect any data for me.  
but, I am very beginners so i'm afraid if something is wrong.  
So I thinks you should know that.  

My firstpost is how to Markdown input new_line  
it's very simple just to add two space when the end of the sentence;  and new line add '#'

 *for example*
 >Hi everyone, Hello world!  (when end of sentence, add two splace)  
 >Here is next sentence!
